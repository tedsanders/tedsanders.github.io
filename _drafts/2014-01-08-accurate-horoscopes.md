**Aries** (21 March - 20 April)
Be open to learning new things, no matter your age. Even obscure phrases like “otanjoubi omedetou” can come in handy, especially if you find yourself at one of Japan’s famous cherry blossom festivals.

**Taurus** (21 April - 21 May)
Be on the lookout for a birthday near early May.

**Gemini** (22 May - 21 June)
It never hurts to be prepared for a surprise party, especially around early June. You may express surprise when you realize that surprise parties are thrown when they are least surprising.

**Cancer** (22 June - 22 July)
Around early July, expect to complete yet another lap in your perennial race around the sun. Conserve your energy, though - it’s unlikely that you’ll pass anyone soon.

**Leo** (23 July - 22 August)
To make your dreams come true, you’ll need to work hard, especially if your country’s schoolyear begins in September.

**Virgo** (23 August - 23 September)
A winter power outage may have contributed to your conception, or perhaps it was merely the sexed up holiday atmosphere. Either way, expect to meet more Virgos than any other sign.

**Libra** (24 September - 23 October)
Stay vigilant and remain on guard. You never know when your birth month might have a Latin prefix for 7 or 8, but in actuality be the 9th or 10th month of the year. Never be afraid to blame the Decemviri.

**Scorpio** (24 October - 22 November)
As Congress sells off the last of the US strategic helium reserve, you should capitalize on the artificially low price of this non-renewable resource and buy some balloons around November.

**Sagittarius** (23 November - 21 December)
Always remember that if your parents’ van is a rockin’, don’t come a knockin’. Especially during the month of March.

**Capricorn** (22 December - 20 January)
Your generosity may go unnoticed, but don’t let that deter you. Giving more than you receive has been typical for Capricorns as far back as the days of Jesus. (However, if your friends and family don’t celebrate Christmas, then nevermind all that. Instead, expect your birthday haul to be relatively decent.)

**Aquarius** (21 January - 19 February)
With no other evidence, you’d do well to predict that your birthday is the most common birthday there is. You’d also do well to exercise humility, on the off chance you were wrong. Which you would be, in this case. By a lot.
 
**Pisces** (20 February - 20 March)
You are more likely than average to become an [NHL player](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/081208 "March is best for NHL players") or [CEO](http://business.time.com/2012/10/26/best-and-worst-months-to-be-born-if-you-want-to-be-the-boss/ "March is also best for CEOs"). But beware - if you fail to become an NHL player or CEO, you will deserve to feel worse than average.
