Yesterday I spoke with some experts on polymer solar cells. Here are some things I learned:

1. The main expert I spoke to is extremely bearish on the commercial prospects of polymer solar cells, even long term. The main advantage of polymer solar cells is they are cheaper than silicon solar cells (but also lower quality). Unfortunately for polymer solar cells, the price of silicon solar cells has plummeted so much that the cell is no longer the limiting cost for a solar installation. These days, most of the cost comes not from the cell itself, but from ancillary costs like permitting, installation, wiring, inverting electronics, structural support, and the module for holding the cell. As a result, even if you invented a crummy solar cell that was free, you wouldn't want it. Efficiency is becoming more important than cost. (This perhaps validates plenty of academic solar research where cost is mostly ignored.)

2. Also worth mentioning: Beyond cost, another hoped-for advantage of polymer solar cells is weight and flexibility. Some have dreamed that one day you could essentially staple a flexible polymer solar cell to the wall. (This makes me think polymer solar cells might have some advantage by helping drop the cost of installation and structural support. But then again, silicon solar cells can be potentially made as thin as 0.1 mm, so I'm guessing flexibility would be a bigger boon than weight.)

3. The plummeting cost of solar cells means that now regulation and permitting are now big drivers of cost. In California, for instance, solar permitting is done by each county individually, which stymies the ability to streamline installation economies of scale. Improving regulation and permitting are huge low hanging fruits for making solar electricity cheaper. Unfortunately, sometimes scientific progress goes faster than legal progress. Getting a genius breakthrough from an individual can be easier than getting dumb consensus from a group, sadly.

4. Research into dye-sensitized solar cells has almost entirely died. Though once promising, progress in this area has been slow, and nearly everyone has jumped ship into the much newer and more exciting perovskite solar cells.

5. Perovskite solar cells came out of nowhere a few years ago. Scientists don't understand exactly how they work, yet the record efficiencies are already around 20%. (For reference, the ultimate limit of regular solar cells is about 30%, the record silicon efficiencies are about 25%, and real commercial silicon cells are about 20% or a bit under.)

6. One big problem with current perovskite solar cells is that they're full of lead. Scientists have made some perovskite solar cells based on tin (the element above lead on the periodic table), but the tin-based cells aren't as good, and the experts I talked to were not hopeful about their prospects. Apparently having a big atom is likely helpful for good metallic conduction.

7. Incidentally, I have studied perovskite materials for years, so it tickled me to hear the solar cell experts' ignorance of perovskite materials. They were wondering if people had even investigated these materials before (the answer is yes, for more than half a century). Also, I mean no disrespect - we're all ignorant about tons of stuff. I suppose the lesson is that it's important to network with people in adjacent fields.

8. One expert remarked to me how amazing it is that polymer solar cells work as well as they do, given how few experimental knobs there are to turn. Essentially, the process goes like this: you choose a polymer material, you spin-coat it onto a substrate, you bake it, and then *presto* you have a polymer solar cell. The only stuff you control is choosing your polymer and adjusting your bake procedure (temperature and time, mostly). And from this simple recipe comes a material with impressive performance in the many qualities required for a high quality solar cell. That said, a second expert disagreed that this was amazing and pointed out that there is a ton of work/potential in choosing and designing your polymers. (Aside: it's very interesting when people say that a result is surprising or counterintuitive. A common pattern I see is that others quickly deny that they are surprised by the result. I never know whether they do so to look smart, or because they accept truth too willingly, or because maybe to them it really is straightforward. Experiencing surprise is a sign of weakness, because it signals you are not omniscient. God never experiences surprise.)

9. Speaking of how simple it is to make a polymer solar cell, the simplicity and cheapness of it is partly why the field has exploded with interest. It costs only ~10,000 to buy the materials and equipment necessary to make a working (but not great) polymer solar cell. Many research groups can attempt small test projects before committing expertise and money to a major research effort.

10. Reproducing some of the early results of perovskite solar cells has been very difficult. Some of this is because some labs accumulate a lot of expertise and secret sauce, but some of this is also because scientists are not very honest. Perovskite solar cells exhibit a strange hysteresis as you sweep voltage, so if you do weird things like sweep voltage from positive to negative very quickly, your solar cell will have a higher "efficiency" than if you you swept voltage slowly from negative to positive. Standardizing and publicizing measurement techniques is important for the field, but unfortunately there are not strong incentives to do so.

11. Apparently, you can make a super stable polymer spin-coater out of a CD drive. This sort of makes sense since CD drives have had millions (or billions?) of dollars invested into making them very precise. I always think it's cool when cheap everyday products find use in high-tech research. No reason to reinvent the wheel when another industry has already turned super precise wheels into a commodity.
