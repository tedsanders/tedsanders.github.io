Two obvious reasons, one nonobvious reason that we can learn from.

(1) Better brains

(2) More free time

(3) LACK OF EGO. When you're a kid, you're bad at everything. So being bad at something is not an obvious reason to quit. But when you're an adult, you're good at stuff (sometimes). And when you encounter something new as an adult, something that makes you feel dumb and uncomfortable, your instinct is to retreat to the warmth and safety of things you know already. Kids have the advantage of having no warmth and safety to retreat to. They're bad at lots of things.
