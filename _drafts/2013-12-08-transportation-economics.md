Fun facts about the economics of transportation.

Transportation is dominated by big steel: cars, ships, planes, trains.

* The transportation design that has become dominant is the big metal container pushed by a hydrocarbon fuel engine. (Specifically cars, ships, planes, and trains.)
* How should we evaluate transportation options? Often there is a tradeoff between capital costs and marginal costs (the road is a big fixed cost, the car is a partly fixed partly marginal cost, and the fuel is a marginal cost). Flexibility, scalability, and robustness are also important.
* When it comes to storing chemical energy, nothing is as dense as hydrocarbons (a bunch of tiny hydrogen bonds arranged in chains). Even if we run out of naturally occuring hydrocarbons, it will probably be worthwhile to artificially synthesize them. Nobel laureate Bob Laughlin has humorously referred to hydrocarbons as "Schroedinger's fat."

###Cars
* Roads are amazingly flexible.
* Donald Shoup argues there are inefficies in parking regulation. (Though a recent variable price parking pilot doesn't seem to support his main hypothesis)
* Improving a car from 10 MPG to 20 MPG saves more gas than from 20 MPG to 100 MPG.
* If battery and inverter technologies can be improved, electric cars could be used to help stabilize the grid and accommodate variable power sources like solar.
* Dimpling cars like golf balls to improve aerodynamic efficiency is silly. Cars are so much bigger than golf balls that low-friction turbulent flow already occurs naturally.


###Ships
* A ship shipping shipping ships photo
* Like many industries that mature, employment has fallen, capital investment has risen, and control has been consolidated
* There is not much worker protection on ships because no country has strong jurisdiction over ships
* The shipping container made shipping way more efficient and spelled doom for longshoremen
* Shipping is very efficient. No roads or tracks need to be laid and vehicles can be as big as you like (unless you want to go through particular canals).

###Planes
* Planes are very expensive
* As a result, they get flown all the time (plane utilization rates are far higher than car utilization rates)
* It's conceivable that other transportation options could be electrified, but because weight is so important to planes it's likely planes will always rely on hydrocarbons (the only power source dense than chemical fuel is nuclear fuel, but so far no one has invented a lightweight and safe and portable nuclear reactor)

###Trains
* American rail is much better than people realize. Our passenger rail is terrible, but our freight rail is great.

###Fundamental limits
* Fundamentally, the only energy that *needs* to be expended is energy used to gain elevation. In principle, friction can be reduced arbitrarily low and the power needed to accelerate a vehicle can be recaptured by braking systems.
* The way to approach this fundamental limit is to build tubes and pump out all the air. Vehicles can float on magnets to avoid energy losses from wheels. This has been called Vactrain and is similar to Elon Musk's hyperloop idea.
* There are two major downsides to offset the prize of energy efficiency. First, the capital costs are very high. You have to spend a lot of money up front to save on fuel costs down the road. Second, the system would not be robust. If there is a single leak or crash, transportation along the whole line would be blocked. This is one reason that cars and ships are better than rail - if another car or ship crashes, you just drive around them.



###The shipping container
* The shipping container has made life on Earth better
* Everyone likes efficiency
