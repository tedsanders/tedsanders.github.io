Recommended by both Cook's Illustrated and a bevy of Amazon reviewers, I bought the CDN ProAccurate Quick-Read Thermometer for my basic cooking needs. This $18 gadget is nearly as good as the best-in-class Thermapen, which sells for $90. The thermometer reads temperatures in seconds and my tests in boiling water and ice water showed that it was calibrated well. If you cook meat and don't want to die, this digital thermometer is a great investment.
