Also, an interesting paper that looks at the historical rate of solar cell improvement (~9% W/$ per year for the past 30 years): [On improvement rates for renewable energy technologies: Solar PV, wind turbines, capacitors, and batteries](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.03.002)

Analysis coming soon.
