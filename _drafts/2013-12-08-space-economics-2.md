How much does it cost to get to space? What room is there for those costs to drop?


Picture of space. Picture of Earth's gravitational potential well.

###Propulsion

For you to go forward something else has to go back. Cars push back on roads. Ships push back on the sea. Planes push back on air. But in space, things are different. There's nothing to push back against. Nothing, except for what you bring yourself. If you bring a pebble, you can throw the pebble backward to propel yourself forward. This is the idea behind rocket propulsion. (To do this efficiently, you need to throw the propellant backward as fast as possible, which is why rocket design is so important.)



###Technical limits

Minimum energy required to get to orbit (above the atmosphere): 0.5 kWh per kg, $100 of electricity for a person
Minimum energy required to get to geostationary orbit: 15 kWh, $3,000
Minimum energy required to get away from Earth (escape velocity): 17 kWh, $3,000

It's potentially very cheap to get to space. However, realizing this potential is hard.

###Costs

It's expensive to get stuff into space. In the future, rather than sending up fuel and widgets, it may be cheaper to send up robots that can work on the moon or asteroids

###Space debris

Space debris could be a serious problem. Space is easy to get dirty, but nearly impossible to clean. It will really suck for Earth satellites collide in low-earth orbit and cause a chain reaction of destruction. Because the effects are so irreversible and long-lasting, this needs to be a high priority.
