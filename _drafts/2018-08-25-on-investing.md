*   Investing is working earlier to gain later
*   The concept of investing can exist without the concept of money
*   The concept of investing can exist without the concept of increasing value
    *   For example, putting leftover pizza in your refrigerator will not increase the pizza's value, but will allow you to consume the pizza later
*   The concept of investing cannot exist without the concept of time
    *   Furthermore, the concept of investing is only useful when defined over durations, not instants
*   In economics, investing is production minus consumption
    *   [GDP equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Components_of_GDP_by_expenditure): Y = C + I + G + (X - M)
    *   [Savings identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_identity): I = S + (T - G) + (M - X)
*   Like much of economics, the concept of investing applies most clearly to manufacturing of durable goods and applies least clearly to human brain states
    *   For example, when a college student listens to a lecture, is she working to earn a future grade? Or is she gaining from her past tuition investment? Not all human experience clearly fits into the labels of work or gain.
*   Humans lives follow a common pattern of investment. We consume as children, we produce as adults, and we sometimes consume again as retirees. Our species persists only because each generation invests in the next.
*   Governments often force people to invest. Infrastructure, schools, science research, and social security are funded through a combination of taxes (involuntary unpaid work) and bonds (voluntary paid work).
*   Investments larger than the work of a single person require cooperation. Cooperators must agree how to split the work and how to split the gains.
*   Money is a tool that makes work and gains easier to split.
*   Financial investing is paying money now to get money later.
    *   Financial investing is really no different than economic investing, but because labor gets swapped for money it can be harder to track. For example, if you buy a Disney bond that finances construction of roller coasters, your past labor is being exchanged for future fun via a path of: [your labor] -> [your wages] -> [your purchase of a Disney bond] -> [Disney paying wages to roller coaster builders] -> [builders' labor] -> [a durable roller coaster] -> [roller coaster riders paying Disney's ticket prices] -> [roller coaster riders having fun] (and [Disney paying back its bondholders]).
*   A priori, it's not obvious that financial investments should pay premiums to the investor rather than the investee. A financial technology that allows me to store my work and then withdraw it at any time in the future is a service worth paying for. Certainly, a world could exist where people pay banks for the privilege of sending the value of their past work forward into the future. But generally there are more people who want to pull money from the future than push money into the future, so the market clearing price rewards the pushers over the pullers. This imbalance happens partly because people tend to prefer sure things now rather than unsure things later. This is the fundamental reason financial investors paid a premium for their investment.
*   In theory, returns come from four sources:
    *   (1) the preference for sooner over later (the real risk-free rate)
    *   (2) the preference for certainty over uncertainty (the risk premium)
    *   (3) people being dumber than you in a way that you can exploit more than others (alpha)
    *   (4) Getting lucky (epsilon)
    *   One puzzle in economics is why US stock market returns are as high as they are. Returns over the past 100 years were much higher than economic models expect given the risky swings in price. One hypothesis is that investors are irrational. A second hypothesis is that many risks was priced in, but we got lucky and many of those risks didn't show up. Both are surely true to some degree. Much has been written on the equity premium puzzle ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle), [a literature review from the mid 2000s](http://www.altruistfa.com/readingroomarticles.htm#EquityPremium)).
        *   It's perhaps possible that this equity premium is already gone and we just don't know it yet. If we suppose that investors realized over the course of ten years that stocks were an anomalously good deal, and bid up the price for ten years, that one-time bidding up of the price would make it continue to look like stocks are an anomously good deal (ten more years of anomalously high returns!), when in fact that one-time run up was the anomaly going away. (This line of argument just occurred to me while writing and therefore is extra likely to be wrong.)
*   One puzzle is why the risk-free rate is what it is
    *   Like many useful concepts, the risk-free rate is a fiction. There is no such thing as zero risk. Plus, preferences are not constant across people, time, places, meaning there are many rates, not just the one.
    *   A common proxy for the risk-free rate is the rate on short-term US treasury bonds
    *   Today the rate is around 1% per year. It's been trending downward since the mid 80s when it was 5-10%.
    *   After the Great Recession the real risk-free rate briefly dipped below 0% in the US, and in Japan and Europe even the real risk-free rate dipped below 0% (!)
    *   What determines the risk-free rate is a deep question. My hypotheses:
        *   The directionality of time (stuff can be sent into the future, but not the past)
        *   Technological progress (we can make stuff more easily in the future than in the past)
        *   Population growth (a growing population requires net investment into children)
        *   Diminishing returns to wealth (because individuals tend to accumulate wealth, the same unit of wealth will bring more happiness early versus later)
*   Stocks and bonds are similar. With both, you supply money now in exchange for uncertain payment in the future. One difference is the order in which investors are paid. If a company goes bust, bondholders are paid before stockholders, which is why bonds are less risky than stocks. A second difference is ownership rights. Bondholders don't own the company and can't change the company. But shareholders own the company and can (usually) intervene in management if they so choose.
*   No one knows what future returns will be. Each moment in history is unique. Looking back at historical data (such as US stock market returns) suffers from massive uncorrectable selection bias.
*   Market efficiency
    *   A priori, there is no obvious reason to expect markets to be efficient. However, empirically, this seems to be roughly the case. Mutual fund returns show [shockingly little](http://www.altruistfa.com/readingroomarticles.htm#Persistence) persistence. One explanation of this is that if someone finds an opportunity in the market, money will be invested into that opportunity until (a) so much is invested that the opportunity disappears, or (b) the discoverer of the opportunity closes its doors to outside investment. In either case, outside investors don't win.
    *   Obviously the model of efficient markets is not strictly accurate when taken literally
    *   In theory, the efficiency of markets should scale with the profits that can be made from them. The US stock market is humongous and liquid, so it is probably one of the most efficient markets on Earth.
    *   Furthermore in theory, the inefficiencies that persist in the market should approach the amount that can be earned by paying a smart person a wall street salary and giving them lots of tools plus some risk premium
*   Alpha
    *   To earn alpha, you must believe something that's (1) true and (2) non-consensus
    *   Furthermore, I'd add that (3a) the belief must be justified and (3b) that [justification must be correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem); otherwise your returns were luck (epsilon) rather than skill (alpha)
    *   Speculative: it seems to me that greatest opportunities for alpha are in areas where measurement is hardest. My hunch is that it's easier to win on long-term macro bets rather than short-term bets. Long-term bets are harder because you have fewer cycles to learn and test (which makes causal identification difficult), and with long-term marco bets you are exposed to more risks unrelated to your thesis behind your bet (which again makes causal identification difficult). The tricky thing is that if someone does win in such a manner, with fewer independent bets and poor causal identification, it's more difficult to distinguish between luck and skill. And in cases where the universe only rolls the dice once, defining the difference between luck and skill approaches philosophy.
*   The shift toward indexing
    *   [Equity index fund market share over time](www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v72.n1.5)
        *   1975: 0%
        *   1985: 0%
        *   1995: 4%
        *   2005: 16%
        *   2015: 34%
    *   What's more, index funds aren't just winning new dollars - they are winning old dollars too. As John Bogle [writes](http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v72.n1.5) in 2015:
        *   "An even more dramatic story is told by the cash flow into (and out of) equity mutual funds. Since 2008, index funds have accounted for 160% of net cash flows into equity mutual funds. During those seven years, investors have made net purchases of almost $1 trillion in passively managed index funds even as they have liquidated, on balance, $600 billion of their holdings in actively managed equity fundsâ€”a remarkable $1.6 trillion swing in investor preferences. Such a dramatic turnabout in investment strategy is, I believe, without precedent in the mutual fund industry."
    *   It's amazing to me that passive funds / index funds took as long as they did. For a long time, index funds were non-consensus, swimming upstream against profit-motivated misinformation from finance companies and journalists. Now they seem to be the default option. I'm not sure how it changed, but my sense is that the internet has made us more savvy and sophisticated. (This perception is doubtless colored by my own filter bubble and my own coming of age, but nonetheless feels true to me.)
    *   That said, many ETFs are counted as index funds even when they are not used in the spirit of index funds as long-term passive investments.
    *   Over the past decade humans have invented many indices. There are apparently now [~70x](https://www.moneyobserver.com/news/there-are-now-70-times-more-stock-market-indices-listed-stocks-world) more indices than stocks (~3M indices vs ~40K public companies). They have been predominantly created to benchmark active funds.
*   High frequency trading
    *   My impression of high frequency trading (potentially erroneous as always) is that although it is a great waste of resources due to its negative-sum nature, it's less of a great waste than the market making that came before it. Lower bid-ask spreads mean that naive buyers and sellers are getting ripped off less than they used to. Also, parasitism of big traders reduces the incentives for big traders to research the market, which might be a good thing for society. (But it might be bad, too.)
*   How does a dollar this year compare to a dollar next year? (TBD)
    *   Inflation - inflation usually means a dollar next year is worth less than a dollar this year
    *   Ok, what if we account for inflation?
    *   Mismeasurement of inflation - if anything, inflation is underestimated
    *   Ok, what if we account for inflation perfectly?
    *   Productivity growth - an hour of labor this year will produce less than an hour of labor next year. Therefore, if I value an hour of labor equally, hmm
    *   If I invest X hours of labor this year to save Y hours of labor next year, then I have saved Y-X hours of work. then the productivity growth is Y/X. If I work the same number of hours each year then production rises Y/X.
