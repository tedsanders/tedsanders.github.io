The economics of solar power.

1. About half the value of solar comes from the energy it produces and about half comes from the power produced. (If this doesn't make sense, don't worry. I'll leave it to you as a puzzle.)

2. One problem with residential solar today is that by law the solar inverter must output all real power and no imaginary power (i.e., the current and voltage must be in phase). This needs to be changed eventually.

3. Solar has tremendous upside since there is sunlight everywhere. Many power sources are not large enough to power the world (geothermal, tidal, hydro, etc.).

4. The maximum possible efficiency for a regular solar cell is 31% (sometimes quoted as 34% - the exact figures depends on your reference spectrum).

5. 4n^2 limit? Moth eyeballs? Nanowires?

6. If interest rates fall, making solar cells last longer will be a higher priority.

7. Uh, I'll write more things later.

8. Solar cell prices over time look good.
