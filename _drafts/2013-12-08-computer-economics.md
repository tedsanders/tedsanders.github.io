Fun facts about the economics of computers.

* In principle, a computer can use zero energy. However, if a computer erases information (ejects information might be a more accurate term), that should cost kT log(2) on average. This is about 100,000 less than the energy used today.

* Moore's law will end, and it may be ending already. Historically, making transistors smaller made them faster, cheaper, and use less power. But since 2003, they haven't gotten any faster. And today we're at the point where they aren't getting cheaper. The savings that come from fitting more transistors on a wafer and finally being eaten by the costs of higher resolution lithography. EUV (extreme ultraviolet, also known as x-ray) lithography planned for the next process nodes, but it's still too expensive. Alternative to EUV are parallel e-beam (which has problems going fast because of space charge and data transfer limits) and also sideways transistors (which require extreme etch control).

* Intel and Samsung are so desperate for EUV lithography to work that they invested substantially in ASML, the company trying to build these EUV systems, and they also bought Cymer, the San Diego excimer laser company (technically, the term should be exciplex loser, because it uses molecular complexes, not dimers, and the laser is an oscillator, not an amplifier).

* Regardless of the materials or geometry, normal transistors always have to use at least 60 mV to amplify the channel current by a factor of 10. Today's transistors use about 70-100 mV, so we're already pretty close to the limit. The only way to improve here is to either make our circuits more reliable and sensitive (which is hard as transistors get smaller and hence more variable), or else to use a substantially different design. The two most plausible future designs I've heard of are tunnel FETs (which rely on tunneling for better amplification) or ferroelectric FETs (which use a ferroelectric gate as a voltage amplifier, effectively).

* The computer chip business is extremely capital intensive and getting more mature. As a result, the industry has been consolidating a lot.

* Suppose Moore's law ends. What will happen then? R&D will have lower returns, so R&D spending may fall (but R&D will still be useful). Demand for computers will fall, causing quantity supplied to fall, causing higher prices because of economies of scale (this sort of happened to DRAM a year or two back). However, I predict that this will be swamped by downward pressure on the price - now capital equipment will produce chips for decades instead of years, spreading out the high fixed costs. Circuit design will be the main way of innovating, and we should expect to see more investment in radical redesigns. Consolidation of the industry will continue.

* The ascent of humanity has been due entirely to using our smarts to invent technology that makes things easier to do. The invention of the integrated circuit, which allowed us to print entire circuits without wiring anything together, ranks high on humanity's all-time greatest inventions.
