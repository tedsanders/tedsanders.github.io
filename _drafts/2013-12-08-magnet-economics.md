The economics of magnets.

1. Magnets are a $30 billion industry (world GDP is about $100 trillion, meaning that for every $100 in your wallet, three dimes are spent on magnets. About $5 is spent on magnets per person per year.)

2. I'll put up some good plots of magnet progress

3. Magnetism is a relatively unique branch of science, because it fundamentally depends on the physics that causes the Pauli exclusion principle.

4. Magnets are used in big heavy industry (in motors) as well as in the high-tech industry (as hard drive platters and read heads)

5. MRAM has serious potential to replace DRAM. MRAM is non-volatile, so computers would automatically hibernate when power is shut off.

6. Magnetic logic is an interesting idea (but with no real short-term potential).
