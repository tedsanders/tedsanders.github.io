<p>Below is some interesting demographic information from the 208 of you who have visited the blog so far:</p>


<h3>By Country</h3>
<figure>
<img src="{{site.url}}/img/traffic-by-country.png" />
<figcaption>
This blog has a slightly international readership with hits coming from the UK, Canada, Germany, France, India, Japan, and the very-hard-to-believe Turks and Caicos Islands. Curiously, the hit from Japan was from someone googling "Ted Sanders" in Japanese.

<h3>By State</h3>

<figcaption>
Looking at the US alone, my readership extends as far west as Hawaii and as far east as Massachusetts, with big voids in the Rockies and the South. 18 states down, 32 to go.

<figcaption>
Unsurprisingly, most readers are concentrated in California and Oregon, the only two states I've lived in.

<h3>By City</h3>
<figure>

<figcaption>
With only two unique visitors, Los Angeles doesn't make the top ten, but I think that's because the LA metro area is divided into so many small cities.

<h3>By Operating System</h3>
<figure>
<img src="{{site.url}}/img/traffic-by-OS.png" />
<figcaption>
As always, Windows wins. The iOS hits are from 18 iPhones and 7 iPads.

<h3>By Browser</h3>
<figure>

Which of you is still using Internet Explorer? Whoever you are, please know that I forgive you.

<p>My roomates have pledged a $5 donation to our apartment jar if I can get hits from all 50 states, so if you'd like to contribute our next community purchase (likely a giant living room white board), please tell all of your Wyoming friends about this blog.</p>
