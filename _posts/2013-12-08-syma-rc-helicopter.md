For only ~$20, this helicopter makes an awesome gift! The price is reasonable, and almost everyone loves to play with it. Because it's so lightweight, it's mostly impervious to crashes (unlike larger hobby copters). I highly recommend it!

(My only reservation in my recommendation is that it may not last longer than a year. One of ours no longer generate enough lift to fly, possibly because of the aging battery.)
