<p>Welcome to my blog. With this blog, I hope to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advocate ideas that are undersold and underrated</li>
<li>Refine my thinking through writing</li>
<li>Prove to the dude at <a href="http://www.tedsanders.net">tedsanders.net</a> that I'm more of a Ted Sanders than he will ever be</li>
</ul>

<p>Blogging is new to me, and I'm not sure where I'm headed. However, I do have some ideas about the direction I intend to set out. In particular, I plan to share my thoughts on a few topics that I've been thinking about deeply: robots, money, and energy/climate.</p>

<p>Those of you stalking <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tedsanders">my Facebook timeline</a> know that a recent interest of mine is the rise of machines replacing labor. The economic tradeoff between capital and labor is <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Ricardo/ricP7.html#Ch.31, On Machinery">nothing</a> <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Marx.html">new</a>, but as machines become increasingly capable of decision-making, the traditional balance between dumb tools and smart humans may collapse, forcing society to confront the ugly reality of what to do with people who are more expensive and less productive than robots. <a href="http://theleisuresociety.tumblr.com/post/39057729530/the-tech-debate-blasts-off-a-linkfest">Arguments</a> over this scenario have become popular in the economics blogosphere, and I plan to add my two cents.</p>

<p>A second subject that I might stray into is personal finance, a part of our lives that most of us plan to do better at... eventually. With the advent of the internet and its ocean of freely accessible information, there is no longer any excuse to not invest in the best stocks or donate to the best charities. I'll tell you how. Not only will I summarize the expert consensuses on both <a href="http://www.altruistfa.com/readingroomarticles.htm">investing</a> and <a href="http://www.givewell.org">charity</a>, I'll give you step-by-step instructions for getting started.</p>

<p>A third topic where I plan to share some expertise is energy and climate. How we choose to power the planet for the next century is a hugely important question whose answer will have large lasting consequences. As someone who has worked at a utility and attended years of energy seminars with free food, I will examine some subtleties of the issue that most journalists miss.</p>
