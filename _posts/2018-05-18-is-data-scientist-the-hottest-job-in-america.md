# Is data scientist the hottest job in America?

What is the hottest job in America?

Some articles say data scientist is the hottest job in America, because companies want them so badly they are willing to pay over $100K per year.

However, I'm going to say that CEOs, hedge fund managers, and sports stars are actually the hottest jobs in America. Companies want them so badly they are willing to pay over $10M per year (equivalent to a century's worth of data sciencing!).

Why do people choose to write articles proclaiming a shortage of data scientists but not a shortage of CEOs/hedge funders/sports stars?

Presumably it's because I won't click a headline that says athletes get paid a lot, but I might click a headline saying that data scientists get paid a lot. And why is that?

Is it because data scientist feels achievable, so maybe I'd want to become one?

Is it because data scientist is in my social class and CEOs are not, so maybe I'd be more envious and status-conscious?

Is it because data scientist salaries are getting paid more than a cultural interpretation of what they "deserve" and I care about strangers getting what they deserve?
