<p>This page highlights some of my unpaid service to humanity.</p>

<h2>Charity</h2>

<p>Did you know that 2 billion people live on less than $2 a day? (<a href="http://www.onedayswages.org/about/what-extreme-global-poverty">Source</a>)</p>

<p>If everyone in the richest 1 billion donated just $2 a day, we could double the incomes of the poorest 2 billion. That we don't do this is absolutely tragic.</p>

<p>I try to do my part by donating $2 a day to the charities recommended by <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and I encourage you do too. Most human suffering on Earth is entirely avoidable, and it's embarrassing to our species that we don't avoid it.</p>
