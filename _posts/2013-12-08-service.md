I try to be a good person. I hope you try too, because your actions matter.

<h2>Charity</h2>

<p>Being extremely poor sucks. A lot. So does being sick, for that matter. And what sucks even more is that much of this awful suffering from poverty and disease is easily within our power to prevent. If top billion richest people (like you and me) each donated a dollar a day, we could double the incomes of the bottom billion just like that. I try to do my part by donating 10% of my income to the charities recommended and vetted by <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and I encourage you to give too, if you can. Much human suffering on Earth is avoidable at low cost, and it's embarrassing to our species that we don't help each one another more.</p>
