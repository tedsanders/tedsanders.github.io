Energy is an industry marked by high capital costs and low R&D. So it's not surprising that transitions take decades. Here are some possible revolutionary technologies that could change in our lifetimes:

## Generation

* Quantum well solar cells (or other high-efficiency concepts)
* Exciton-based thermoelectrics

## Storage

* Ultra batteries with ultra long cycle life

## Efficiency

* VacTrain or Hyperloop
* Magnetic refrigeration
* Lighter cars?
* Magnetic levitation of transitions
* Smart grid
* Millivolt switch
* Using heaters made of computers
*

## Transportation

* High voltage DC
* Superconductors
