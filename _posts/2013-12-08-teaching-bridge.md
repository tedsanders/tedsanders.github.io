>Question: What do Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have in common?

>Answer: They're both billionaires and they both love the card game bridge.

>If you too aspire to become a bridge-playing billionaire, then the first step is to learn how to play bridge! (Sadly, the second step is not covered in this class.)

>Bridge is a fun and brainy card game somewhat like hearts. It's played 2 vs 2, so good communication and teamwork are key to victory. (Another benefit of bridge being played 2 vs 2 is that if you ever lose - hypothetically, of course - you've got someone other than yourself to blame!)

>This class is for anyone and everyone who wants to learn bridge. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY!

<p>This was the description for my latest bridge class, which I co-taught with former Womens World Champion Debbie Rosenberg. Together, we introduced 24 middle school and high school students to the classic card game of bridge. We designed our class from scratch, using a sequence of eight hands to build up concepts one at a time so that by the end of the class, the students could play bridge on their own. Read the ACBL's coverage of the class <a href="http://www.acbl.org/news_archive.php?id=842">here</a>.</p>

<p>Post-class surveys showed that kids loved the class - our class was rated 5.0/5.0, more than a point above the <a href="https://www.stanfordesp.org/">Splash</a> average, and one student called it a "Phenomenal class, Perfect job!!!" I'm proud of the job we did.</p>

<p>Bridge has been a passion of mine since high school, ever since I founded a bridge club at my high school to teach myself and others to play bridge. At one point I got so obsessed with bridge that I pulled an all nighter on Christmas eve - not for normal reasons like last-minute gift wrapping or anxiety about coal - but because I was playing online bridge with one of my friends. Fortunately the <a href="http://www.acbl.org/index.html">American Contract Bridge League</a> doesn't discourage obsession when it comes to bridge, and they actually awarded me a modest scholarship for my bridge teaching.</p>

<p>If you too would like to learn the game of bridge, take a look at at my <a href="/bridge-handout.pdf">class handout</a> or better yet, visit <a href="http://bridgebase.com">bridgebase.com</a> to download their amazing interactive bridge tutorial software (the first link in the left box).</p>
