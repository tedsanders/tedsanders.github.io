title: On self-driving cars

*   Highlights
    *   The potential market for self-driving cars is enormous, something like ~5% of world GDP
        *   Roughly, I estimate potential market of $5T assuming value of $5 per hour times 1 trillion hours of driving per year ([~1B cars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/number-of-vehicles-in-use-worldwide/) * [1 hr/day](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/how-much-time-do-americans-spend-behind-wheel) + 300M commercial vehicles * 6 hrs/day)
        *   $5T may sound high, but the average American driver spends [7 hrs/wk driving](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/how-much-time-do-americans-spend-behind-wheel), which is 20% of the [~35 hrs/wk worked](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS#) by the average American worker.
        *   
        *   Actual market may be lower as competition drives prices down. But may also be bigger in the future as (1) the world continues developing and (2) lower prices increase quantity demanded.
    *   Self-driving cars are nowhere near as safe/reliable as humans, nor will they be soon
        *   From 2014 to 2017, Waymo's reported disengagement rate fell from 1 per 800 miles to 1 per 5,500 miles.
        *   At this rate, reaching the human crash rate of 1 per 330,000 miles will take 6 more years.
    *   The transition to self-driving cars will be gradual
        *   The first release of almost every technology is expensive and crummy
        *   Capital-intensive technologies can take decades to penetrate markets
    *   The
*   Conceptions of self-driving
    *   Essentially, driving is a function that takes vision as input and outputs steering, speed
    *   I see three important dimensions for imagining how future cars will be driven:
        *   Who drives (autonomy)
            *   Human mostly drives (SAE levels 0-3)
            *   Computer mostly drives (SAE levels 3-5)
        *   When & where do they drive (environment)
            *   Highway-only
            *   Heavily mapped zones in good daytime conditions
            *   Everywhere
        *   What are they driving (cargo type / vehicle type)
            *   Passenger, owned (car)
            *   Passenger, hailed (taxi)
            *   Passenger, shared (shuttle, bus)
            *   Cargo, short-range (trucks)
            *   Cargo, long-range (semi-trailer trucks)
    *   SAE defines 6 levels of autonomy.
        *   Level 0: No automation
            *   E.g., anti-lock brakes, cruise control
        *   Level 1: Drive assistance (in some circumstances, computer may adjust speed or steering)
            *   E.g., Automatic emergency brakes, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance
        *   Level 2: Partial automation (in some circumstances, computer drives while human monitors)
            *   E.g., Tesla Autopilot, Cadillac Super Cruise
        *   Level 3: Conditional automation (in some circumstances, computer drives while human is ready to take over)
            *   E.g., Audi Traffic Jam Pilot (only <60 kph on divided highways)
            *   Many carmakers plan to skip Level 3, as humans cannot be relied upon to take over on short notice
        *   Level 4: High automation (in some circumstances, computer drives without need for human)
        *   Level 5: Full automation (in all circumstances, computer drives without need for human)
    *   Focusing too much on SAE levels may make it seem as if there is one path for the technology to progress along 1->2->3->4->5 or that the levels are equally spaced in difficulty. But many cars may have different capabilities in different environments (e.g., level 4 on a highway, level 2 around town, and level 1 in a construction zone). And it could easily turn out that getting to level 4 takes 1,000x the R&D spend than it took to get to level 2.
*   History
    *   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_autonomous_cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_autonomous_cars)
    *   The idea of autonomous cars is not new
        *   1950s-1960s: Early research into autonomous highway driving using buried cables. A number of groups build prototype cars that drove down highways with buried cables. Never commercialized.
        *   1980s-1990s: First computer-controlled self-driving cars using cameras and sometimes LIDAR. EUREKA program invests ~$1B in self-driving car research over 8 years. CMU first uses neural networks for self-driving control. German group drives prototype 620 miles on highways. American group drives 3,100 miles (steering only). Italian group drives 1,200 miles. Cars required constant supervision: disengagements occurred roughly every ~1-10 miles.
        *   2000-2010s: In 2007, six cars complete DARPA Grand Challenge III, an urban course populated with human drivers. Autonomous trucks are commercialized for mining. Neural networks begin dominating computer vision contests like ImageNet. Google, major carmakers, and startups invest billions into autonomous driving.
*   Benefits
    *   One of the biggest blind spots in forecasting the impact of future technology is to ignore the market growth caused by the technology
        *   Example: valuing Uber at only $5.9B because you assume the taxi market is a fixed size. In fact, the number of rides in NYC doubled in the 10 years after Uber's debt.
        *   [http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/)

    *   Nevertheless, I will
    *   ~$1T/yr from reducing collisions (roughly ⅓ deaths, ⅓ injuries, ⅓ economic costs [property/lost productivity/congestion/medical bills/etc.])
        *   $0.5B cost of crashes globally: [http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics](http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics)
        *   $0.24B economic cost, $0.6B human cost of crashes in US: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/motor-vehicle-crashes-u-s-cost-871-billion-year-federal-study-finds](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/motor-vehicle-crashes-u-s-cost-871-billion-year-federal-study-finds)
        *   Most of these costs are negative externalities on victims and society
        *   Note much of this reduction might be possible with non-self-driving technology (e.g., automatic emergency braking, breathalyzers, modern safety features); therefore the marginal value of self-driving technology might be lower than the total above
        *   Causes: ~23% of costs attributed to alcohol, ~15% of costs attributed to distraction
        *   Locations: ~10% on highways, ~44% in intersections
        *   Styles: ~36% roadway departure, ~41% single vehicle, ~10% involve ped/cyclist
    *   Free time
    *   No drivers
    *   Some consumer research has been published, but I don't trust it. BCG/WEF survey says ~60% of buyers would not pay more for self-driving. ~20% would pay $5K+.

*   Costs
    *   R&D costs
        *   Google v Uber trial revealed that Google spent ~$1B between 2009 and 2015 (seems low, given Lewandowski bonus of $120M and other reported bonuses. Figure possibly doesn't include salaries/bonuses.)
        *   GM plans to spend ~$0.6B/yr on AV R&D ([https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2017/04/13/gm-to-add-1100-jobs-cruise-automation/100437028/](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2017/04/13/gm-to-add-1100-jobs-cruise-automation/100437028/))
        *   Waymo probably in similar ballpark (~500 employees @ estimated $1M per employee = ~$0.5B/yr) [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2217900793%22%5D](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2217900793%22%5D)
        *   Add in Velodyne (~300 headcount) and MobileEye (~700) and Tesla (???) and major automakers (???) and major parts suppliers (???) and other startups (???) and LIDAR makers and chipmakers and we're maybe in the ballpark of $5B a year being spent on AV R&D
        *   If development takes ~20 years (2010-2030), that's ~$100B in total R&D spend that needs to be recouped from sales
        *   If in 2030 Earth produces 100M cars per year, of which 10% are self-driving, and the R&D price premium is $1,000, then it will take 10 years to recoup $100B in R&D -
        *   As a point of reference, it costs automakers ~$1B in R&D spread over a few years to develop a new model of car
    *   Variable costs
        *   Original Google car had ~$150K of extra equipment (~$75K LIDAR and ~$75K other)
        *   Two largest costs are LIDAR and electronics
        *   LIDAR
            *   ~$80,000 for high-end Velodyne LIDAR (less for low end)
            *   Waymo says their LIDAR cost is 10% of their earlier ~$75K
            *   There are hopes for solid-state LIDAR that cost as low as ~$100
            *   Personally I have no sense of what's going to happen here - huge investment and economies of scale should drive rapid price declines, but so far my sense is that solid-state and cheaper LIDARs are still pretty crummy
        *   Electronics
        *   Radar
        *   Cameras
        *   GPS / IMU
*   Safety
*   Effects on society
    *   If driving gets cheaper, it's easy to predict the direction of changes:
        *   People will travel more by car
        *   People will travel less by buses, subways, trains, bicycles, etc.
        *   Delivery will be cheaper
        *   Cities won't get as dense, since the cost of living far away is lower
        *   Cities will get denser, since the cost of congestion falls and the need for premium parking falls and fewer cars will fill the roads looking for parking
        *   Less parking will be built on premium land and more parking will be built on low-cost land
        *   More cars will be built because driving gets easier
        *   Fewer cars will be built because car sharing gets easier
        *   More kids and seniors will be able to get around
        *   People will travel more during offpeak times (unlike Uber/Lyft drivers, robotaxi capacity will be constant throughout the day)
        *   People will travel more during peak times, as waiting in traffic isn't as bad
        *   Increased fleet purchasing will make car designs more boring (https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/27/ways-to-think-about-cars)
    *   It's harder to predict the magnitude of changes:
        *   If most driving is for peak-time commutes, then car sharing won't reduce demanded capacity by much
        *   If cheap robotaxis help fill in the gaps of public transportation, the demand for even cheaper public transportation could actually go up
        *   If people like having their own car with their own stuff in it, then robotaxis won't take over and car production will go up, not down
        *   If you still need a human to unload delivered goods, then delivery actually won't get much cheaper
        *   As the cost of congestion goes down, the amount of congestion will go up, so deadweight loss caused by congestion may not actually fall a huge amount (rebound effect)
        *   Self-driving tech will reduce taxi rates ~33% according to my math:
            *   A 30-minute Uber drive costs about $30. Assuming a 50% utilization rate, that means they are earning $30 an hour. Uber charges ~33% of that, ~$10, leaving $20 for the driver and the car (this agrees with studies showing ~$20/hr for driver and car https://medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/an-analysis-of-ceeprs-paper-on-the-economics-of-ride-hailing-1c8bfbf1081d). Gas costs ~$3/hr (assuming 1 gal/hr at 30 mpg at 30 mph), car depreciation costs ~$3/hr ($20K car lasting 200,000 miles at 30 mph), and maintenance/repairs/insurance costs ~$3/hr ($0.10/mi at 30 mph). This leaves $11/hr for the driver. So very roughly, ⅓ goes to Uber, ⅓ goes the car, and ⅓ goes to the driver.
            *   Suppose adding self-driving tech to a car costs $13K and eliminates the driver cost. That will add $2/hr in costs and subtract $11 in driver wages. So total cost drops 30% from ~$30/hr to ~$21/hr.

        *   
        *   Neglected factors that will refine the math above: (on balance, they will probably lower the price a bit more than calculated, and more so in the long-run)
            *   **The cut taken by ridesharing apps will fall.** Ridesharing software costs are mostly fixed, so with higher volumes they can better afford to drop their cut. (But right now these companies are bleeding billions, and reversing that bleeding will work in the opposite direction)
            *   **Some of the driver savings will go toward fleet management, not price cuts.** Right now, drivers take care of fueling their car, keeping it clean, and parking it. Presumably some of that $11/hr for drivers would go toward fleet management rather being turned into price cuts for riders.
            *   **Electrification will grow the market.** If electric cars get cheap enough, their lower fuel costs and lower maintenance costs would lower the variable price of driving and thereby increase both the driving pie and ridesharing share of the pie, leading to better economies of scale
            *   **Densifying markets will increase utilization and lower costs.** Greater fleet size could lead to less empty driving and more revenue per mile driven
            *   **Cars with high utilization will last more miles.** Cars depreciate as a function of both age and distance. Higher utilization rates will allow cars to drive further before age-related damage kicks in. Lifetimes could go from 200,000 to 300,000 miles, or even further if cars are redesigned to last longer.
            *   **Discount rates make upfront R&D and equipment less affordable.** Including interest rates tilts the balance toward drivers and gas versus self-driving and electric, both of which have higher up-front costs. (I expect real risk-free rates to stay below 2% due to secular stagnation; therefore, I expect discounting to be dominated by the risk premium.)
            *   **Redesign of cars will lower costs.** As volumes of self-driving cars grow, it becomes worthwhile to redesign lower cost cars suited for self-driving. E.g., no steering wheel, no pedals, optimized for distances/environments, optimized for passenger load, self-driving hardware built-in rather than bolted on.
            *   **Insurance rates will change.** I expect self-driving car insurance to cost more than human car insurance. This is because (1) self-driving cars may be more dangerous than humans when released, (2) insurers will require a premium to take on uncertain risks, and (3) self-driving cars will carry thousands of dollars of hardware that will need to be inspected and replaced after collisions. (Of course, this is all subject to notions of what's a "fair" comparison.) Note too that as self-driving cars get safer and penetrate the market, this will not only lower the price of self-driving car insurance, but also the price of car insurance.
            *   **Transportation rules could be redesigned.** Long term, high penetration of self-driving cars opens up possibilities for new, more efficient road rules, which could increase road speeds and bandwidths, and thereby lower cost of service.
        *   One thing I don't understand is that taxis in Dhaka, Bangladesh cost like $4/hr. Presumably cars and gas cost the same all over Earth but labor is super cheap in some countries. One way to get at the labor share vs capital share of fares is to look at countries with low wages. Dhaka taxis cost like $4/hr ($8/hr at 50% utilization), which is much lower than my estimate above. Maybe the cars are older and crummier, repairs and maintenance are way cheaper? Non-Uber taxis appear similarly priced, so it cannot explained by Uber choosing to take a negative cut to build the market.

*   Predictions
    *   Prediction is where analysis becomes most difficult. It's easy to sit on the sidelines, disprove obviously wrong predictions with back-of-the-envelope math, and smugly bask in the feeling of "I know better." But it's another story to put my own skin in the game, and make predictions that will likely be wrong in one way or another.
    *   None of the predictions below are meant to be definitive. Just my best guess at the moment I wrote them down. Certainly there are people in the world smarter and more informed than me who will be able to make narrower, more accurate predictions.
    *   As informative as individual predictions are, there is also meta-information encoded in the predictions I choose to make and the way I define problems. I have tried to mostly pick predictions that are easy to unambiguously falsify.
    *   My predictions
        *   Self-driving is solvable (100%)
        *   Level 4 city+highway self-driving cars will be generally available for sale to consumers by...
            *   2020: <1%
            *   2025: 10%
            *   2030: 45%
            *   2035: 60%
            *   2040: 70%
            *   2045: 75%
            *   2050: 80%
        *   Level 4 city+highway self-driving cars that cost <$30,000 will be generally available for sale to consumers
            *   2020: <1%
            *   2025: 2%
            *   2030: 15%
            *   2035: 30%
            *   2040: 55%
            *   2045: 65%
            *   2050: 75%
        *   Level 4 city+highway self-driving cars will debut in fleets years before being sold to individuals (90%)
        *   The biggest barrier to adoption will be the technology (safety, reliability, cost), not regulation (though of course there may be regulations saying they are illegal because they are unsafe)
        *   The transition will be very gradual
            *   Self-driving car production going from 0.1% of new cars to 80% of new cars will take more than 20 years
            *   By 2050, the majority of cars on the road will not be self-driving
            *   In the taxi market, self-driving cars will takes many years to usurp Lyft/Uber/etc. At first they won't have much cost advantage, they will face large barriers to entry (fleet density, consumer inertia), and building a fleet will take tons of capital relative to Lyft/Uber's bring-your-own-car model (literally billions of dollars per large city). As a result, the rollout will be slow and done city-by-city, probably starting the US.
    *   Other predictions
        *   Be cautious generalizing a mood from these past predictions. There is a massive selection bias in the predictions below. They are not a representative sample of predictions. The main lesson is not that it's fun to laugh at the predictions of people in the past; the main lesson is to be humble in our own predictions lest the people of the future laugh at us.
        *   In 1940, the book _Magic Motorways_ suggested we'd have self-driving cars in 1960
        *   In 1960s, a number of practitioners suggested we'd have self-driving cars in 1975

Progress since DARPA grand challenge has been astounding

Evolutionary path

-Driverless vehicles that can go anywhere are many years off

-To get there, there are two possible intermediate paths: 'go anywhere' first or 'driverless' first

-One path is partially autonomous vehicles that still have drivers. This is what luxury carmakers are doing.

-The second path is fully autonomous vehicles fenced to certain heavily mapped regions during daytime or good weather. This is what Waymo is doing.

-Trucking looks similar. The first autonomous trucks may be highway-only autopilot with drivers present, or highway-only autopilot with no drivers.

Safety

-Human drivers experience about 1 fatality per 100 million miles driven (note this is just the mean - for drivers who drive in urban environments, drive sober, and wear seatbelts, death rates are likely 10x better)

-Therefore, proving that autonomous vehicles are less fatal than human drivers will take billions of miles. (For reference, in 2017 Waymo drove about two million miles.)

-Dropping roughly 3% per year for the last 100 years ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year))

-About 1/2 in daylight and 1/2 in nighttime

-About ¼ involved of drivers had positive blood alcohol (so presumably way more than ¼ of collisions, if most collisions have two drivers)

-⅔ of fatalities are in the car, ⅓ are outside of the car ([https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812482](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812482))

-½ of passenger vehicle occupant fatalities were not wearing seat belts

-Wearing your seat belt reduces odds of both death and injury by about 50% ([https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812413](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812413))



    *   Definitions are important for clear communication. Many outrageous predictions become less outrageous once you realize they are using definitions different than your own. For example, Stanford's AI100 2016 report writes: "A recent report predicts self-driving cars to be widely adopted by 2020." To me, this prediction sounds outrageous. But if you follow the source they summarize, you'll see that what it really predicts is that by 2020, 0.8% of cars will have driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control or automatic emergency braking. The prediction becomes less outrageous once you realize that the Stanford AI100 working group is defining "widely adopted" as 0.8% and "self-driving" as having driver assistance features.
