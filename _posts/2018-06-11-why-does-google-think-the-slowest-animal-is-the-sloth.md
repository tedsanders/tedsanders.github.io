# Why does Google think the slowest animal is the sloth?

Google [writes](https://web.archive.org/web/20200809222648/https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/):

>Our mission is to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

This is pretty hard, but Google has been at it a while. Let's see how well Google is doing by asking it for some basic factual information, like the slowest animal.

Google says it's the three-toed sloth:

To see just how wrong this is, take a look at this video of a sloth climbing a tree:

Can you imagine a [1 millimeter snail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_organisms#Animals) moving this quickly? A sponge? A coral? A [tardigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)? A 100-micron long mite?

It takes almost no research at all to see that the sloth wouldn't even be invited to the slowest animal Olympics, let alone win the gold medal.

Google has plenty of company though.

Siri guesses that it's the *two-toed* sloth:

Bing returns images of sloths, but text saying it's the seahorse:

Cortana returns text saying three-toed sloth while its first image is a Gila monster:

Although DuckDuckGo doesn't elevate an editorial snippet, it returns 8 images of sloths and 1 image of a loris:

YouTube's top hit for animals used to say seahorse, but today says the three-toed sloth:

WolframAlpha gets it the closest yet, returning the brown garden snail and explicitly states that it reinterpreted my query as the slowest *land* animal:

Wikipedia returns an article with slowest animal by phylum and class, including coral with a speed of 0 m/s:

I find it quite interesting that of the 8 websites I asked, the only website that got the answer partially correct was the also the only website that's a non-profit.

**2020 update:** Despite being higher quality that all results returned by search engines, the Wikipedia article was deleted for being too low quality. Alas.

If you [ask Google for a shirt without stripes](https://github.com/elsamuko/Shirt-without-Stripes), it shows you shirts *with* stripes:
![Google search for shirt without stripes](/images/shirts-without-stripes-google.png "Shirts without striples - Google")
To be fair, 'without' is a pretty tricky word. Amazon and Microsoft fail at this too. -->
