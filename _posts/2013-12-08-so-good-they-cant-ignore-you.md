This short, structured book profiles a series of successful professionals to lay out four rules for finding a fulfilling career.

* Rule #1: Don't Follow Your Passion
* Rule #2: Be So Good They Can't Ignore You
* Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (Or, the Importance of Control)
* Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big (Or, the Importance of Mission)

The thesis of the book is that the best way to find a fulfilling career is to build career capital and leverage that capital into a job with autonomy and mission. The author asks what makes a job great? His answer: creativity, impact, control. But since great jobs are rare and valuable, how do you get one? Answer: become rare and valuable yourself, by building career capital (accumulating useful skills/experience).

Here are some nuggets I'll try to remember:

* According to the forty-year-old Self-Determination Theory of psychology, motivation requires three psychological needs: Autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

* Asking what makes you happy doesn't necessarily lead to happiness: "There are two reasons why I dislike the passion mindset.... First, when you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you donâ€™t like about it, leading to chronic unhappiness."

* Deliberate practice (straining yourself and receiving feedback) is underemployed by knowledge workers: "Musicians, athletes, and chess players know all about deliberate practice. Knowledge workers, however, do not. This is great news for knowledge workers: If you can introduce this strategy into your working life you can vault past your peers in your acquisition of career capital." 

* A study of chess players who had played chess for about ~10,000 hours found that the proportion of time spent studying chess versus playing in chess tournaments was the dominant predictor of success. Grandmasters spent about 5,000/10,000 hours studying, while intermediate players spent about 1,000/10,000 hours studying. (Rings very true.) The moral is that showing up is not enough; to excel, you must strain yourself.
