<p>The following assumes that you are a childless PhD student earning a modest stipend plus tuition remittance.</p>

<p>Don't sue me.</p>

<h3>How to properly claim tuition deductions/credits</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Most PhD students should not be claiming any education deductions/credits.</p></li>

<li><p>If tuition is paid on your behalf:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't count it as income.</li>
<li>Don't claim any deductions/credits because of it.</li>
</ol></li>

<p>In short, tuition paid on your behalf shouldn't show up anywhere on your tax return. (Even if you see it on your university billing statements.)</p>

<li><p>Room &amp; board, most fees, and books generally do NOT count as qualifying expenses for the education deductions/credits.</p></li>

<li><p>However, if you have a scholarship/fellowship, the cost of required books and course supplies can be subtracted from your taxable stipend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the most part, you can only claim education deductions/credits when you pay out-of-pocket for tuition and required fees (and even then, not all required fees qualify, such as required health services fees).</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Fellowships &amp; Scholarships</h3>
<ul>


<li><p>Fellowship stipends are taxable, even if they don't send you tax forms. (The only portion that isn't taxable is the portion spent on tuition and qualifying expenses like required fees and required books.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you didn't receive a W-2 for your fellowship, list it under OTHER INCOME (and weep, because it doesn't count toward earned income for the purposes of <a href="/roth-ira/">Roth IRAs</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don't have Federal and State tax withholding from your fellowship, you are probably required to pay quarterly estimated tax. (Even though you file taxes only once per year, you should be paying taxes throughout the year. The US tax system is pay-as-you-go.)</p>

<p>Schedule quarterly estimated federal tax payments at <br /><a href="https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/">https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/</a>.</p>

<p>Schedule quarterly estimated CA state tax payments at <br /><a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/payment_choices.shtml">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/payment_choices.shtml</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

</li>
<li><p>You are not head of household. (Unless you are taking care of someone and more.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even if something doesn't send you a tax form (such as a fellowship, or a bank that paid you less than $10 in interest) you still owe taxes.</p>
