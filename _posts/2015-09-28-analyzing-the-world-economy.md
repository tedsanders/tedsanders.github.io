Analyzing the Econonmy

Measuring value is hard.

One decent proxy is the price paid. Obviously it's imperfect.

MECE frameworks are always useful.

We'll look at a few possible frameworks with increasing granularity.

First, there is the framework of

AGRICULTURE:INDUSTRY:SERVICE

(Also called PRIMARY:SECONDARY:TERTIARY which is less exciting, but more accurate and comprehensive.)

(Also called EXTRACTION:PROCESSING:DELIVERY)

You either collect stuff from Earth, turn stuff from Earth into other stuff, or do things for people.

Worldwide, we're at about 6% AGRICULTURE, 30% INDUSTRY, and 64% SERVICES.

The lines between these are always somewhat blurry. For example, is the frycook at McDonald's producing hamburgers or providing a service to already existing burgers? Hmm. There are many more examples.

Some people have optionally added the QUATERNARY sector, which  splits services into two categories: transportation/retail and other services. And there is sometimes also the QUINARY sector, which includes decision-making.

Some of these frameworks are ancient. The Edo period of Japan divided citizens into four classes: peasants/farmers, artisans, merchants, and samurai. The peasants/farmers were the RAW MATERIALS or AGRICULTURE class, the artisans were the MANUFACTURING class, and the merchants and samurai were the SERVICES class. (The funny thing is that the ranking of the classes in order of prestige went samurai, farmer, artisan, merchant. But eventually the merchants and artisans got rich while the farmers and samurai got poor. It was awkward.)

Another ancient example of the class system conforming to these economic frameworks was in Japan's neighbor, China. The Chinese system actually came before the Japanese system and influenced much of East Asia. The Chinese 'four categories of the people' system divided and ranked as follows: Scholars > farmers > artisans/craftsmen > merchants.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_occupations)

Although these classes had distinct names, there were not necessarily treated differently. Some scholars maintain that this system was more rhetoric than reality.

Many professions did not fit neatly into this classification. Miners in Japan were considered below or outside the four-occupation system. Slaves, prostitutes, bards, bums, and others were also considered outside the system. And at times, the lines between the classes blurred. In the Ming dynasty for example, people would work the farms during one season and do crafts during the other seasons.

Plato also had classes, but based more on politics than economics. He had the producing class, the warrior class, and the ruling class. (Actually not so dissimilar from farmer/artisan, samurai/scholar) [Also see Plebe/Patrician]

Farmers were generally well regarded historically: "Cicero considered farming the best of all Roman occupations" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_agriculture, and see Chinese four occupation system (many examples in ancient Rome/Greece/China/etc.)

In modern times, some economists have grouped workers into four new occupation classes: farm workers, service workers, manual workers, and white collar workers.
