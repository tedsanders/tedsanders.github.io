Fun facts about the economics of energy.

Climate Change
The big uncertainty in climate models is cloud feedback. Will cloud cover rise or fall with increasing temperatures?
The contribution of CO2 to warming is not linear - the effect saturates at high concentrations.
The impact of temperature on life is also not linear (presumably 2 degrees is more than twice as bad as 1 degree).
The bending mode of CO2 is responsible for most of the light that CO2 absorbs.
In theory, cap & trade assumes the marginal cost of pollution to be infinite while a flat carbon tax assumes the marginal cost of pollution is constant (neither is true).
In practice, cap & trade is equivalent to a carbon tax (The carbon tax is legislatively flexible and cap & trade is bounded).
A carbon tax will not significantly affect the production of oil ($30/ton is proposed; $200/ton would be needed to make a difference today).
Global cooling may be more cost effective than carbon abatement.


Oil/Gas
Reserves are defined by the discovered oil in the ground extractable at below market prices.
The amount of untapped oil is much larger than defined reserves.
The big uncertainty in future oil extraction is technology (whether discovery and extraction technology lags or leads the depletion of low hanging fruit).
For biofuels to replace oil, they must handily beat the average cost of extraction (~$20/barrel), not the marginal cost of production (~$100/barrel).
10 -> 20 MPG saves more gas than 20 MPG -> 100 MPG.
Hydrocarbon fuels are the densest way to store chemical energy (lots of small hydrogen-carbon bonds).
When oil runs out, synthesetic oil may become a large industry (not as a source of energy, but as a fuel).

Coal
Mercury emissions cause more damage than CO2.
Coal plants have high fixed costs and low marginal costs, making them expensive to replace.
There are hundreds of years worth of coal, especially in the USA and China.

Batteries
Battery costs are driven by materials, which cannot fall much (with caveats).
Battery energy density is also unlikely to improve much - atoms don't get much smaller than lithium and hydrogen.
The greatest room for battery improvement is cyclability.
For grid energy storage, I spectulate that the most promising technology is hybrid ultra capacitor lead acid (which promises a capacitor's cyclability along with a battery's capacity).
Natural gas is better than batteries at voltage regulation (with today's technology/market).
Electric car batteries cannot feasibly supply power to the grid - the inverting electronics are too expensive.
