I love red curry. In efforts to recreate my favorite restaurant dishes, I've tried red curry pastes from Thai Kitchen, Trader Joe's, Berkeley Bowl, and Mae Ploy. Mae Ploy blows the competition out of the water - I highly recommend it.

The only caveat: the price on Amazon seems to be higher than the price in stores ($1-$5?). Do your own comparison.

Happy eating!
