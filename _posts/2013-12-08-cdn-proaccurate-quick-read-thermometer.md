Recommended by both Cook's Illustrated and all these Amazon reviews, I bought the CDN ProAccurate Quick-Read Thermometer for my basic cooking needs. $90 seemed a bit steep for the best-in-class ThermaPen. Anyway, from my brief use so far, the thermometer is great! It reads temperatures in seconds and came well calibrated based on my ice water and boiling water tests.

Happy cooking!
