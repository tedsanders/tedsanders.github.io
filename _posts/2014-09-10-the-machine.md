I'm not all that informed but that's never stopped me from speculating before. A few assorted thoughts:

1. Much of this is marketing. HP has been working on many of these projects (resistive RAM for better memory, photonics for better communication on and between chips, etc.). 'The Machine' is more of a concept idea of how all these projects could potentially be merged into a single computer of the future. But many of these projects remain somewhat independent and I doubt 'The Machine' will ever be a real product.

2. Also, claims by HP should (obviously) not be trusted at face value. In 2011, HP said they'd have a memristor SSD out in 18 months. Now, 36 months later, that product is nowhere to be seen. They have far more incentive to overpromise than underpromise. (HP's excuse was not that they failed, but that it would cannibalize their partners' memory sales. Hah. Again, they don't have many incentives to admit failure.)

3. The dream of universal memory has been around for a long time. Right now there's a whole hierarchy of memory technologies in use (SRAM, DRAM, SSD, HDD) that trade off between speed and cost. People think that if we could invent a new technology that eclipses this whole trade-off frontier, we could have way better computers and a radically simpler architecture for memory management. This is partly why HP says they want to invent a new operating system for 'The Machine.' However, even if there was a universal memory, I suspect there would still be a memory hierarchy and memory management, based purely on proximity to the chip. The further away a memory bit is from the CPU, the less valuable it is. Even with a new universal memory, computers will still probably spend resources shuttling high-value and low-value bits around the chip. I think one thing HP has said is that they want to put their memory on top of the chip, but I don't really know how that would work (or why it can't work already with SRAM, for instance).

4. The term 'memristor' is also a bit of marketing. Most people call this technology resistive RAM instead, and some people accuse HP's memristors of not being purely memristive and therefore not true memristors. Also, I have read some cynics who argue that because HP owns some key memristor patents, HP is actively trying to broaden the definition of memristor so that their patents will be more valuable. That said, I can't directly vouch for any of these claims myself.

5. One general problem with evaluating claims about new technologies is that advocates of the new technology will make claims like 'Technology X has the potential to be 100x better than current Technology Y.' However, those comparisons are not very fair or informative. Oftentimes Technology Y *also* has the potential to be 100x better than it is, and if you compared X and Y on a purely potential basis, X would no longer look so good. It's like saying cars are faster than planes since the fastest car goes at 750 mph and the average plane goes at 500 mph. Sure, theoretical souped up cars are faster than the average constrained plane, but when both are souped up, planes win, and when both are constrained, planes win (not the perfect analogy, but I hope you see my point).

6. Another general problem is temporal comparisons. Even if it's true that in five years Technology X can beat today's Technology Y, that's not the right comparison to make. What you really want is to compare Technology X in five years with Technology Y in five years - that's what will determine the viability of your product. Bad temporal comparisons destroyed a lot of solar companies in the last 5-10 years. Lots of California solar startups got funding because they had prototypes that looked competitive against current silicon panels. Unfortunately, by the time they got their prototypes manufacturable, the silicon solar industry had continued to plow ahead and had cut costs by a factor of 2 or 3.

7. All that negativity aside, these technologies have real potential and a lot of money is being poured into them by many parties. I do really hope they succeed. (But success is hard. Not only does your technology have to be better, but it has to be sooooo much better that it can overcome the incumbent technology's dramatic headstarts of fixed R&D costs, best manufacturing processes, supply chains, economies of scale, labor force development, etc.).

8. Coincidentally, I just came from a panel with an HP photonics researcher. I had meant to ask him about his thoughts on 'The Machine' but I didn't have time to, unfortunately.


**Update, June 2015**: HP has killed The Machine (or at least significantly changed its vision). Can I say I called it? Here's a nice write-up by my friend Joel Hruska: [http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/207897-hp-kills-the-machine-repurposes-design-around-conventional-technologies](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/207897-hp-kills-the-machine-repurposes-design-around-conventional-technologies)
