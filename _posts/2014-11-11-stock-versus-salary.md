When it comes to employee compensation, I'm often surprised at the stark difference in language used to describe stock and salary. (To me, stock and salary are both forms of compensation - the only significant difference is the risk.)

For example, today Ben Horowitz (the famous Silicon Valley venture capitalist) gave [a lecture on how to manage startups](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec15/). In one portion, he discussed stock options, and argued that exiting employees should not necessarily be allowed to take their stock when they leave. He supported his argument with three reasons: (1) Giving your employee their stock would dilute everyone else's share, (2) keeping their stock if they leave gives them an incentive to stay, and (3) it's unfair if employees get your stock plus stock from whatever new startup they join.

Did that logic sound reasonable to you? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

But now imagine he said the same thing about salary. E.g., (1) If we pay you salary for the work you've done so far, it makes the company poorer which will hurt other people's salaries. (2) If we keep some of your salary when you leave, it gives you incentive to stay. (3) It's unfair that if you leave for another company, you'll get paid for the work done for us AND get paid in the future for work done for them.

That sounds a little bit more crazy, no?

While I see the utility of delaying payouts to your employees, I also worry about the incentives. How would you feel as an employee if you were promised a $1 million bonus after working at the start up for 5 years, but then you were fired 4.9 years in? Nonlinear payment structures don't just change the employee's incentives---they also change the employer's.
