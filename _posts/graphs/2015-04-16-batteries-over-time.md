Also, here's an interesting paper that looks at the historical rate of battery improvement (~3% kWh/$ per year for the past 60 years): [On improvement rates for renewable energy technologies: Solar PV, wind turbines, capacitors, and batteries](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.03.002)

Despite the slow progress in batteries, car battery packs (which started at a higher price) have been falling quickly:

Analysis coming soon.
