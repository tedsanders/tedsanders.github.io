[![The ultimate limits of battery chemistries](http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.15872.1393944262!/image/batt2.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/batt2.jpg)](http://www.nature.com/news/the-rechargeable-revolution-a-better-battery-1.14815)

Also, an interesting paper that looks at the historical rate of battery improvement (~3% kWh/$ per year for the past 60 years): [On improvement rates for renewable energy technologies: Solar PV, wind turbines, capacitors, and batteries](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.03.002)

Analysis coming soon.
