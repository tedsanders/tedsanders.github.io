[![The cost of DNA sequencing over time](https://www.genome.gov/images/content/cost_genome.jpg)](https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/)

I'd like to learn more about the costs of DNA sequencing. Here is what I know right now:

Back in the day, the best way to sequence was with [Sanger sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) and a ton of computing power. As computers got cheaper, so too did DNA sequencing. Then a variety of far cheaper and slightly crummier methods came out ([Next-gernation methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-generation_methods)), dropping costs even faster. Those are maturing and now people are working on next-next-gen methods like nanopore sequencing, which has gotten a lot of investment and is still being worked out as you read this paragraph. Assuming you're reading this paragraph now (my now) and not now (you reading this now in the far future). You (k)now?

Analysis coming soon, I hope.
