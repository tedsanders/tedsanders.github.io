[![Magnet energy product over time](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110406/images/Magnet750NEW.jpg)](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110406/full/472022a.html)

Analysis coming soon.

(Coey has some great plots that I'll try to include later.)

More notes from Coey:

+Magnetic material industry is about $30 billion per year
+Three main applications are permanent magnets (high coercivity), soft magnets (low coercivity), and magnetic recording (which has middling coercivity)
+Permanent magnets are mostly either ferrites (mostly Ba2Fe12O19 or Sr2Fe12O19) or NdFeB. Their main application is motors and generators
+Soft magnets are mostly Fe-Si and they are used in inductor cores (e.g., transformers)
+Magnetic recording (i.e., hard drives) use some combination of Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, O ??
+Iron is extremely abundant on Earth, which is pretty fortunate because in many ways it's the best magnetic element
+More coming...
