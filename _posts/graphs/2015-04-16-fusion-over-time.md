[![fusion power over time](http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/LEC26/IMAGES/fig33.GIF)](http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/lecture26.html)

Analysis coming soon.

(Though one thing I can't resist saying is that comparisons of fusion with Moore's law are overblown. The reason that fusion power plants are producing more power is not because they're getting more efficient - they're mostly just getting bigger.)

Some topics to discuss include tokamak fusion, NIF laser fusion, Tri-alpha energy boron fusion, and maybe even cold fusion if I get around to it.
