Fun facts about the economics of launching things into space.

1. A picture of space

2. Today, the most expensive component of rockets is high-skill Russian labor. The best way to make rockets cheaper is to find ways to use less labor. (E.g., cut bureaucracy, automate manufacturing, simplify designs)

3. The minimum energy required to get a person into orbit is about 50 kWh, or $1 worth of electricity. The minimum energy to get a person into geostationary orbit or beyond is about 1000 kWh, or $20 worth of electricity. Rockets are inefficient!

4. Today's rockets are powered with chemical energy, but back in 50's the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)">seriously investigated</a> ships that would propel themselves by dropping nuclear bombs and then riding the blasts forward.

5. Launching from the equators is about 0.3% easier than launching from the North Pole because of the centrifugal force from the Earth's spin.

6. Launching from Mt Everest is about 0.2% easier than launching from sea level.

7. Fuel is less than 1% of the cost of a rocket launch. (For the SpaceX Falcon 9, 0.3% of the budget is spent on fuel and 2% is spent on construction.)

8. The payload of a rocket is around 2% of its weight, a tiny margin. Consequence #1 is that escaping Earth would be astronomically more difficult if Earth's mass was just a bit higher (woohoo!). Consequence #2 is that making [rockets reusable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGimzB5QM1M) (to save tons of money) is very hard because you have very little weight budget to add additional equipment.
