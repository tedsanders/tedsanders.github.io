</p><h2 id='funding'>How Science is Funded</h2><p>Today we take it for granted that science is funded by the government and performed at national labs and universities. However, on a historical scale, this model of science funding is a relatively recent development. For most of human history, advances in science have come from self-funded curiosity, practical investigation with short-term payouts, or from scientists working for benevolent patrons. It wasn't until the 1900s that national level science spending began to blossom. World Wars I and II spurred huge increases in military spending, as well as military R&amp;D spending. During World War II, the United States' Manhattan Project alone cost about $25 billion (in 2013 dollars). Following World War II, Truman science advisor Vannevar Bush laid the foundation of modern science policy in his report, Science, The Endless Frontier, which called for the creation of the National Science Foundation. A few years later Vannevar Bush's request was granted and the NSF was founded. With time, the United States added more science agencies to its portfolio. NASA was founded in 1958, and saw its funding rise and fall with the Cold War. Later, the oil shocks of the 1970s led to the creation of the Department of Energy (and its head, the cabinet-level Secretary of Energy).
</p><p>The US government is the largest funder of science in the world. It spends about $150 billion each year on R&amp;D, broken down as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>70 DOD</li>
<li>30 NIH</li>
<li>15 DOE</li>
<li>10 NASA</li>
<li>5 NSF</li>
<li>2.5 USDA</li>
<li>10 Other</li>
</ul><p>(note: this is not the budget of the whole agency. Just the budget of R&amp;D, rounded to the nearest 5 or 2.5 billion.)
</p><p>Defense is about half the pie. After that, the NIH is largest. A cynic might argue that the NIH has had more success in securing congressional funding because cancer is more relevant to 60-year-old senators than the issue of developing energy sources for the next generation (however, I'm not a cynic so I wouldn't know). Following the NIH are DOE, NASA, and the NSF. 
</p><p>The NSF is unique among US science agencies in that it operates no facilities of its own. So while its budget is smaller than its peer agencies, it is a large force in science funding at universities, where progress is made by professors and their teams.
</p><p>
Most countries have a single ministry of science, but the United States, due to its idiosyncratic history has a rather fragmented system of science funding. Some have argued that this has actually helped the cause of science funding, because it's more difficult to cut from five agencies (and consequently fight five times as many political battles) that it would be to cut the budget of a single agency. Regardless, that's how it stands. For our lab, which straddles physics and materials science and basic research, the three most important funding agencies are the DOD, DOE, and NSF (we don't get funding from the NIH or NASA, because they study biology and space. We also don't get funding from commercial sources because our research is relatively fundamental).
</p><h2 id='publishing'>How Science is Published</h2><p><a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/'>In magazines</a>, sometimes.</p><p>The $10 billion scientific publishing industry is in turmoil. In February 2013, the Obama Administration sent a <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf'>memo</a> to every federal science agency, directing them to make all federally funded research findings available to the public for free. Scientific journals, who charge taxpayers money to access the research that they themselves funded, have a problem. But every problem is also an <a href='http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/06/scientific-publishers-offer-solu.html'>opportunity</a>. The industry has formed an alliance called CHORUS to charitably offer their publishing resources to the government, so that the government doesn't have to build its own solution and divert money from the noble cause of science. In exchange, all they want is millions of dollars. The alternative to CHORUS is for the science agencies to build an open access science website like <a href='http://http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/'>PubMed</a> (which the NIH created years ago) or the <a href='http://arxiv.org'>arXiv</a> (created by physicists in 1991). The agencies have until August to decide the fate of scientific publishing in the US.</p><p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access'>Open access</a>. Green and gold. Yeah.</p><h2><a id='research'>Science I've Done</a></h2><p>The neoclassical model of economic growth, developed by Nobel prize winner Robert Solow (among others), states that long run economic growth is driven by only two factors: population growth and technology. Of these two factors, technology is far more important â€“ it contributes exponentially while population growth contributes only linearly (roughly). Because of this, any society that seeks to maximize long-run wealth and happiness ought to invest heavily in technological research and development.</p><p>The pages below document my meager attempts to contribute to humanity's long-run economic growth rate through scientific research.</p><ul>
