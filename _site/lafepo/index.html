                </header>
                <p>Superconductivity was discovered 100 years ago, when Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes saw the electrical resistance of his ultra-cold mercury plummet to 0. Ever since this fortuitous discovery, physicists have dreamed of finding or inventing a material capable of superconducting at room temperature. A room-temperature superconductor could usher in a new era of super efficient power lines and computer servers and who knows what else.</p>

<p>In the decades that followed Onnes&#8217;s discovery, superconductivity research plodded slowly on, until a <a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01303701'>huge breakthrough</a> in 1986, when IBM scientists discovered a new type of superconductor based on copper. In the span of a few years, scientists found a handful of copper-based materials that could superconduct above 100 K. This temperature was still much colder than room temperature (~300 K), but it was also much warmer than the previous records. The temperature was also significant because it was above the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K), making refrigerated superconductors relatively cheap. Today you can buy liquid-nitrogen-cooled <a href='http://www.amsc.com/gridtec/superconductor_cable_systems.html'>superconducting power lines</a> from American Superconductor, Inc.</p>
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity'><img alt='Superconductor History' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Sc_history.gif' /></a><p>Since that breakthrough in 1986, scientists have renewed their efforts to find new families of high-temperature superconductors. Much of the effort has been focused on materials similar to copper, such as iron. In 2006, this search paid off when Japanese scientists discovered superconductivity in <a href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja063355c'>LaFePO</a>, the first of a new family of iron-based superconductors. 
</p><a href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja063355c'><img alt='LaFePO Crystal Structure' src='http://www.tedsanders.com/img/LaFePO-by-Yoichi-Kamihara.gif' /></a><p>Even after its discovery, questions remained about the superconductivity in LaFePO. Some scientists even doubted that LaFePO was an intrinsic superconductor, <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1265'>claiming</a> that oxygen vacancies were responsible for the observed superconductivity.</p><p>To help resolve this debate, I spent the spring of 2009 working in Brian Maple's physics lab at UC San Diego. We attempted to synthesize purposefully-oxygen-deficient crystals of LaFePO to see what role oxygen vacancies played in the material's superconductivity. We grew the crystals as if we were baking a birthday cake: we purchased powders, mixed them up, and then baked them at high temperature (omitting a few tedious technical details). Afterwards, we measured our crystals using x-ray diffraction, electronic transport, and SQUID magnetometry. Ultimately, our measurements led us to conclude that we had failed to synthesize LaFePO. This failure saddened us and fans of high-temperature superconductors everywhere.
</p><p>However, while I failed to understand the role of oxygen vacancies in LaFePO, I like to think that I succeeded along other dimensions. Working in the Maple lab gave me my first taste of experimental condensed matter physics, the field where I am now earning my PhD. Today I regularly use techniques that I first learned in the Maple lab. This project also taught me the value that comes from teamwork and building good relationships - more than once I can remember the older graduate students volunteering their early Saturday mornings to help us with synthesis steps that were too difficult or dangerous to do alone. Lastly, working on LaFePO also taught me to be resilient when experiments fail, a lesson that has been disappointingly useful throughout my winding graduate career.
