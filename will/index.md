Should any of the beneficiaries named in 3.1. not survive me by 30 (thirty) days I direct that my liquid, monetary assets (savings, bonds, stocks, etc.) go to GiveWell's #1 charity (or should it not exist, to GiveWell itself to grant at its discretion) and that my illiquid, physical assets go to my parents in equal shares.</p>

<h3>4. Special Requests</h3>

<p>I direct that on my death my remains shall be donated to science or medicine if possible, to be carried out by the Executor.</p>

<h3>5. General</h3>

<p>Signed: Ted Sanders</p>
<p>Date: 03 April 2013</p>

<h2 id="socialmediawill">Social Media Will</h2>

<p>Whatever, my accounts can stay up. I guess Hillary Sanders can be the executor and do as she sees fit. I'm not writing my passwords here.</p>


<h2 id="pulltheplug">Advanced Health Care Directive</h2>

<p>I designate the following people as Executors, in order of priority: Margaret Miller, Ken Sanders, Hillary Sanders.</p>

<p>I guess do what you think is best, but please don't waste money on me. It can probably be better spent on the Against Malaria Foundation.</p>

<p>Feel free to pull the plug and donate my body. I would have wanted it that way.</p>
